                        <p>In this innovative project, our aim is to adapt HKUST's campus to better accommodate students from the animal kingdom. Our goal is to reimagine a university environment that caters not just to human needs but also to those of various animal species, considering their unique forms, abilities, and lifestyles.</p>

                        <h3>Learning and Execution Process</h3>
                        <p>The project began with an intensive ideation phase where we merged insights related to potential user characteristics—such as physical form, abilities, language, and habits—and the challenges and needs these animal students might face. We brainstormed various attributes, including body shape, cultural background, environmental needs, and basic survival requirements. These discussions were expanded into detailed profiles for different animal categories. We then created a mind map to visually organize how each category correlates with specific campus adaptations.</p>

                        <p>As the team leader, I spearheaded the presentation of our findings and focused our efforts on crucial survival needs such as water and food accessibility. I led the design of adaptive solutions like water fountains suited for various animal forms and alternative food dispensing methods that diverge from the typical dining hall setup used by current students.</p>

                        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                        <p>This project challenged us to integrate vastly different needs into a cohesive design strategy, which was particularly complex given the diverse nature of animal requirements. For instance, a camel's infrequent water needs starkly contrast with the constant aquatic environment a fish requires. If given the opportunity to refine our approach, I would advocate for a more precise definition of "animal" and suggest categorizing the animals more distinctly to tailor our solutions more effectively. This experience underscored the importance of precise target definition in research and design, highlighting that while a perfect solution may be elusive, clearer goals can lead to more practical outcomes.</p>

                        <p>
                            We aimed to develop a voice agent/chatbot tailored to hospitality environments—such as hotels, restaurants, and theme parks—that would streamline information access for diverse and international students. As exchange students ourselves, we recognized the importance of a tool that could address language barriers, simplify unfamiliar payment methods, and offer quick, reliable information about local services. Our goal was to create a convenient, culturally adaptive solution that empowers users to confidently navigate new settings and fully embrace their travel experiences.

                        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                        <p>
                            I led the brainstorming session using Miro, a virtual sticky-note platform, to explore and consolidate ideas that would be most relevant and beneficial for our project. Ultimately, we decided on developing a payment assistant. Below, you can see a snapshot of our brainstorming process.

                        <h3>User Need Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            For our user needs research, I created an anonymous Google survey with 14 multiple-choice, select-all, and short-answer questions. We gathered responses from around 30 participants—surpassing our initial expectations. About 93% were between 18 and 24 years old, and 43% were from the United States, with the rest from various countries including Mexico, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

Our main goal was to assess the current usage and adoption of different payment methods. We asked participants, “Are you familiar with any of the following payment systems?” and found that Apple Pay, Alipay, and WeChat Pay were the top choices. Additionally, 63% had used foreign local payment systems before, and over 60% indicated they were either “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to use them in the future.

Participants identified several key challenges, including language barriers, difficulties in setting up accounts, and issues linking card payments. We leveraged these insights to shape our prototype and address the most pressing user pain points.

                            My personal contributions included leading the sticky‐note brainstorming session, developing and administering the anonymous user needs survey (including drafting, editing, and ensuring the questions remained unbiased), distributing and promoting the survey on WhatsApp, and analyzing the resulting data to form conclusions. I also conducted a classmate interview for the project video, preparing the interview questions and overseeing the interview process. I'm proud that as a team we collaborated with using our strengths such as Crystal with her storytelling, my research abilities (user needs) and intervewing skills, Wuzi's computational skills, and Freja's usability research skills.

                            Working as a team on this project was challenging in many ways. I realized the importance of clear communication to keep everyone updated on our progress and to coordinate different schedules. Ultimately, we had to work together as a cohesive unit. Our progress with the AI chatbot was especially rewarding—it became a meaningful and practical tool for me as an exchange student, helping me navigate new countries and unfamiliar local payment methods.
